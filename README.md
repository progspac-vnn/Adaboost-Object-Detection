# Adaboost-Object-Detection
This project leverages the AdaBoost algorithm and OpenCV for image classification of various fruits.

## Features

- **Efficient Image Classification**: Uses AdaBoost with a DecisionTree as the base estimator to provide high accuracy for fruit classification.
- **End-to-End Solution**: Complete pipeline from image preprocessing, model training, to predicting unseen images.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves trained models and encoders, allowing for easy reuse without retraining.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn, and joblib.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone
