# Adaboost-Object-Detection
This project leverages the AdaBoost algorithm and OpenCV for image classification of various fruits.

## Features

- **Efficient Image Classification**: Uses AdaBoost with a DecisionTree as the base estimator to provide high accuracy for fruit classification.
- **End-to-End Solution**: Complete pipeline from image preprocessing, model training, to predicting unseen images.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves trained models and encoders, allowing for easy reuse without retraining.
